12/18/23 UPDATE LOG
We hit the ground running with the amazing feedback given last night. These community meetings REALLY do help me, and we listen to MOST ideas. As you can see below, we dont play around when it comes to quality, and what YOU as the player want from YOUR community. Enjoy these nice updates, theres more to come! Thanks for being here, YOU are a big part in Rogues development and evolution!

TRUCKING
• Based upon community meeting we have made multiple adjustments to trucking. Below came from the communities immediate feedback in the first 12 hours.
• Party price lowered from 5K to 3.5K. Price per member is only $100 now.
• Contract generation increased from 30 contracts to 40 contracts.
• Contract generation lowered by almost 50%, meaning almost twice the contracts will generate now.
• Made a check where when it hits the 40 contracts it will now delete the oldest contract and get rid of it.
• Freight jobs got a new "multiplayer". Now freight jobs will take base price and x it by 1.4 making it more profitable.
• Urgent Cargo increased in probability by almost 2x.
• Distance is based upon skill. We increased the distance players can drive per level and will continue to monitor this if it needs to be increased more!
• Made 4 new multiplayers. Fast, Fragile, Valuable, and Distance. These will be applied the higher level you get, and the more money you can make based upon ADA certification, and type of cargo.
• All trailers DO WORK. HOWEVER, they can take and require speciality trucks. This means to do all the jobs, you will need to purchase more then 1 truck! :slight_smile:

CONSTRUCTION
• Based upon community meeting we buffed the job payments a little bit, and really focused on the material drops here. 
• Based upon community meeting we buffed material drops and should be dropping materials more often and frequent.

SCUBA DIVING
• Based upon community meeting we buffed scuba diving and fixed issue with old table inside the loot. Was fixed and adjusted.
• Based upon community meeting we removed rubber and replaced it with other goodies. Dropped copper as well.

• Based upon community meeting we updated loot table to not feature plastic as its already in other jobs. Features now two unique items you will need in crafting.

ELECTRICIAN
• Based upon community meeting we updated loot table to feature 4 loot items instead of 3.

PROSPECTING
• Based upon community meeting we edited these items. NOW, they arent the greatest still yet, but you will definitley NEED these items in crafting, so it does make it worth it in the end. Its a very easy job and fun to do in down time. We do plan on making this more unqiue with speciality drops in the near future like broken glasses, dog leashes, etc. that you will actually be able to scrap into material!

HOUSE ROBBERIES
• Based upon community meeting we fixed issue after getting to level 9 the house robberies would break. This was fixed. Congrats to those who are already level 9, you are now on your way to the IPL, which is a pretty awesome experience robbing an interior that you can sit out of!

• Based upon community meeting we updated it so food boxes don't get removed at the hospital.
• Based upon community meeting we have added so at eclipse, it now features a ped who can give you your items back instead of having to go to a PD. You still can collect them also at PDs as well!
