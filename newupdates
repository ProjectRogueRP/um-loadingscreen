12/5/23 AFTERNOON UPDATE LOG

CRAFTING MAKES IT RETURN!!!
• Crafting has finally made its return! Same great layout and UI, with better logic built in, new ways to obtain recipes, and new things to explore!
• Now you will need to find tables around the state. Once you find a table, you will be able to make said table.
• If I find the Perk Table, Im able to make a table that now lets me specialize in perks. So on and so forth.
• Recipes updated to now take materials based on the item rarity.
• XP Drops improved to give better XP for items actually used to jobs and such. Items that do not do anything for jobs, give less XP.
• We tried to remove as much items that were just blank and bleh like bats as it was being abused before to just make cheap items. Less items the recipe takes to make, less XP it will result. Meaning Hefty crafts good XP drops, where lower crafts give very minimal XP.
• Leveling systems adjusted to now offer randomized XP drops as well, to change things up. Each item has their own random-izer making crafting shift daily and refresh daily.
• Now you will be hunting for 4 tables (currently). These tables offer you the opportunity to make your own crafting table and start crafting certain items for certain XP ranks.
• Once you get a table, you will be able to use it for 21 days, before having to make a new one! This makes the tables worth something, and actually makes you work your towards something rather then getting it once, and your done.

XP BEGINS
• All XP drops have been activated and are in place! You will not start to gain XP in all their respective categories and all XP is active besides cooking, which will come soon to our new job re-writes coming very soon!

AMMUNATIONS
• Ammunations re-worked to now offer boxes of ammo, instead of 1 bullet by 1 bullet.
• Ammunations now offer pump shotguns.
• We plan to bring in 2-3 more legal weapons for the stores in future updates as well!

PAYCHECKS
• Paycheck ped at the big was move to be in the center teller bay at the big bank.
• Also fixed the ATMs at the front of the bank as well

BILLING
• Something I forgot to mention in the update log is a new billing feature that allows workers to earn profits share. This is 10% of whatever the bill was. For instance, If I work at burgershot, and am actually at burgershot, and I bill a person $1000 for XYZ, I get $100 for that bill. This is to promote the players to actually work these jobs for even more pay on the increased paycheck! (this is not controlled by the business and this could increase in the future to give back to the workers as they are why the business is open!) :heart:

PHONE
• Fixed spelling error in Emerald Bar App on the phone.

• Taxi job now works 100%. Includes nice radial functions through your radial menu as well as nice context menus to easily navigate through the job first time clocking on! Head down to downtown taxi cab, and get a job there where you can pull your vehicles out, and start picking the public up today! We want some to PLAYER OWN THIS! Get to roleplaying it and we just might give it ya! (Also offers nice NPC missions for down time :slight_smile: )

STANCING MAKES A RETURN!
• Stancing completed and should be working 100% now!
• Got rid of all floating text and now just has a pop up text prompt saying to Edit vehicle or stance vehicle! 
• *DISCLAIMER: If seen with a god hideous stance, the vehicle will be repoed and not returned. Were not playing with the ridiculous stances this time around. The mechanic who does the stance also will be fired via the government from the shop.*

BOOSTING MAKES ITS RETURN
• Boosting makes a return and is up and running!
• When on any device, you now do an emote to let others know you are doing the hack, or on the tablet.
• We will be working directly with the car scene and the boosting scene to make the lists make sense! For now though, you can start grinding through D and C while we work with them to make this EPIC in 3.0 where it makes sense, is worth it, and exclusive to those players doing the activities.

PEDESTRAINS AROUND THE STATE
• Peds are no longer robots. Gang peds are aggressive and not to be messed with unless you want to do that.
• Random peds might also be packing so watch out who you are just going around punching and being aggressive towards for no reason :rofl: 

DMV
• Updated DMV to now give keys when getting into the vehicle! Sorry about this!

SETTINGS MENU
• The menu to remove clothing and toggle blips was updated to feature the correct clothing codes for the new clothing set up! Fixed for both men and women ITS IMPARITIVE THAT YOU HAVE NO SHOES ON TO BE QUIET :wink:

PLASTIC SURGEON
• Plastic Surgeon is back in the left side of Eclipse Hospital :slight_smile:

MISC
• Added garage to two parking spots at the right of LSC INSIDE the shop
• Added black out tattoos.
• Added 5 hair fades under beard options so men can have cleaner fades.

This is a very juicy update packed full of content that will literally last you HOURS figuring out everything. We of course cant be perfect, and plan to really listen to feedback around XP, and crafting to make sure its fun, KINDA grindy, but rewarding and not useless. Please if you have feedback, WRITE IT DOWN ON A NOTEPAD, and save it for the meetings we plan! We will be having a mid month meeting Wednesday December 13th to touch down with all the players, and see what can be IMPROVED based on your feedback! <3 Thanks all!
