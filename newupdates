12/11/23 AFTERNOON UPDATE LOG
HOUSE ROBBERIES
• Re-wrote the script
• Optimized it more
• Added more exploit checks
• Updated logs

VEHICLE CHOP SHOP HITS THE STREETS OF LOS SANTOS
• A brand new activity that was completely re-written from the previous activity. Nothing is the same!
• Will need to find location of chop shop first, and then figure out how to open the place up for yourself!
• Once you open the shop up, can start breaking down cars (Timer implemented to prevent constant chopping)
• One car can be chopped at a time.
• Completely interactive job and fun to do either in a group or solo. (If doing in a group, you will not be able to chop 2 cars at once. Will have to chop 1 then chop the other, and so on)
• Get illegal car parts that you can then break down even further to get more materials in crafting and such.
• Two tools needs to do the scrapping.
• Timer is sync'd via server so no matter what it remembers where you were at.
• Get dirty money at the end of the job for completing the job.
• Fixed critical issue that prevented the script from launching correctly
• Added sounds to everything to make it more immersive.
• Was tested in the live server to ensure its fully operational and working! :heart:

RECYCLING
• Update recycling/scrapping to feature the new parts added + added a ton of new items such as jewelry and stuff you get from the house robberies!

CRAFTING
• After hearing feedback, I removed degrading off most of the crafting items that you need to collect. (this was pushed at 3AM last night)

DEALERSHIPS
• Dealerships test drives are now at the airport. DO NOT take test drives on open road ways, as you could get into an interaction, and then poof when the test drive is done.
• Updated dealerships to feature a new self purchasing dealership for police. The FIRST of its kind is at Vinewood PD for police officers! They will walk to where their old vehicle purchaser was, and can see the new layout!

VANGELICO HEIST
• Update logs and improved logic for lasers

ECLIPSE MEDICAL CENTER
• Updated the hospital so all beds are lay-able. Simply third eye the MRI tables, X Ray Tables, and all the medical beds and room in D Ward! You will Lay down. Press X to get up! 

DRUGS
• Updated drug bags to now just be all the same. There are two ways to obtain these. You can either buy them off the street from a dealer, OR you can player to player interaction for bags. Puff Puff Pass and White Widow will feature these bags for basically HALF OFF, making it extremely valuable to enjoy player to player interactions, rather then buying from NPC.
• Shears were missed in the last update. Fixed this immediately.
• Everything should be settled and good to go for weed growing, weed rolling, and weed selling.

CLOTHING
• Finished up the cops clothing from last night. Fixed some things, some spelling errors, and cleaned up the last bit we needed to get done. Also finished the woman's duty belts found under T SHIRTS. We ALSO added two clothing T SHIRTS for women that were pretty popular in 2.0. That being the shorts with radio on them, and the upper leg chaps. We will start to release clothing updates weekly centered around the ENTIRE city.

FACTION MAPS
• To ensure fairness and quality, we noticed we missed two compounds from 2.0. That being old TKR and Illuminati factions. We have removed these for the time being they will brought back in once gangs have actually made a name for themselves as a faction and is recognized as a GOOD RP GROUP. This goes for ALL FACTIONS :heart: :slight_smile: 

WHITE WIDOW
• White Widow store for employees to sell their items were fixed and placed back in their shop. Can be found by the counter they put items on for their customers in the middle of the terminals.
• Updated White Widow text for targets

INVENTORY
• Fixed and updated degrade for a lot of the hacking items meant for jobs. They were at like 6 hours. Extended to be 3 days now.
• Updated icons for stashes from a warehouse to an open box.
• Updated icons for Evidence for police from a warehouse to an evidence box logo.

LOCKPICKS
• Lockpicks were breaking due to a incorrect logic written at 3AM. :rofl: Now instead of having a 90% change of breaking, its a 10% of breaking.
