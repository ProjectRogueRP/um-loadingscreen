WINTER LEAVES ROGUE
• While the snow was beautiful I KNOW you all have been asking for no snow. It lasted approx 2 weeks, and the cold front has lifted off LS and the surrounding areas! It MIGHT RETURN for New Years Eve just to enjoy the evening with snow one last time!
• XMAS mapping has been removed.
• XMAS festivities like tress, snow men, the XMAS shop, Advent Calendars, etc. have been removed. We loved seeing everyone enjoy the xmas stuff this year, and we plan on bringing a HUGE event for next year that will include an actual player ran Santa role that will fly over the town for a week and deliver gifts to you all!
• Loading screen updated to feature new intro video and music to get it past the XMAS theme stuff
• Removed snow effects from tires, intro screen, etc.
• Radial removed for Xmas

MILE HIGH CLUB
• Added real physics to the water in the Jacuzzi
• Fixed invisible collision in the Jacuzzi
• Fixed flickering in the Pool
• Fixed collisions on sidewalks

MARKET STATION
• Market Station is now marked on the map with an M so you know where your friends will be at once they fly in!
• Added car rental to the inside of the market station. Simply walk up to the ped, and you can rent a car!

TRUCKING
• Updated trucking contract pools. Now every other day, it will go through a loop and find the higher contracts and get rid of them. This hopefully curves the amount of high tier contracts.
• Lowered contract generation to 5 minutes.
• Updated urgent cargo probability by half.
• Max contracts buffed to 60

LS RIVER
• Fixed flying trees
