THIS WEEK AT PROJECT ROGUE ROLEPLAY

WEEK OF AUGUST 26TH

HOUSE ROBBERIES
• Cooldown between house robberies nerfed by 15 minutes!
• Updated nicer phone drops. You should find them in all houses now not just 2. We also updated the amount of phones you could get by almost 3x. This should significantly change these drops!
• Updated drop rate a bit to make the houses make sure its giving you items over the robbery and not have houses that give 1 single item.

CRAFTING
• Updated crafting recipes to feature a more balance between nicer phone, stolen rPhones!
• Updated a ton of recipes to drop other items and instead add sPhones! These items now have more use then just selling them!

• Crack mixing timer nerfed by 2 seconds.
