THIS WEEK AT PROJECT ROGUE ROLEPLAY

2/26/24 EVENING UPDATE LOG

If you attended our community meeting you heard a lot of great feedback given last night! Like always I like to hit the ground running and why not release a STUPID BANGER to start March Off Right? More to come however this was a lot of the stuff we heard that we fixed right away, with the rest hopefully finished out within the next 7 days! :slight_smile:

RECYCLING
â€¢ Updated Recycling for Screw Driver Sets. Now gives 2, 2, 2 meaning 6 tools each set.
SHOCKING SOLUTIONS
â€¢ Shocking solutions updated and buffed. Now have a 75% chance at getting mats instead of 40% and buffed material drops universally by 200%!
BOOSTING
â€¢ C class updated to now feautre a less overhead in coins invested into C class. before you had the chance to basically pay 14 coins and get 14 coins. Now you are gurnateed profits of AT LEAST 5 coins if not much more!
CONSTRUCTION
â€¢ Material Drops were buffed and are in a solid spot we think
â€¢ Screw drivers added into loot pool
PATCH KITS
â€¢ Patch kits buffed from 50% Engine to 69% Engine
MECHANICS
â€¢ Re-wrote the logic to now feature the pricing coming from society. This means when a custom comes in and orders parts, the money will be charged to the business. Mechanics NEED to charge customers the money themselves, and they will get 10% of the money charged to the customer. Ensure you are adding numbers correctly and such of course!
