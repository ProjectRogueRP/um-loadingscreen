THIS WEEK AT PROJECT ROGUE ROLEPLAY

AUGUST COMMUNITY MEETING UPDATE

INVENTORY
â€¢ Added ability to limit items to only one in an inventory. This is good for items like "bags" and such that we might bring in the future. Huge addition to the inventory!
â€¢ Added ability to stack items with different degrade and also fixed issue with these items only giving one when giving away a stack. Huge addition to the inventory! (This happened due to the items not reading correctly when giving away a stack and checking for items.)
â€¢ Certain items like `Trojan USBs` for instance, are items that do **NOT** stack regardless of durability or not. Items like water **can stack**. So even if they are approx. 10%-12% different in degrades, you will be able to stack these items and clean your inventory up!
â€¢ Again this is a game changer, its just so so so good for the city, and were glad to stabilize everything for the time being!

CONFISCATED ITEMS
â€¢ Updated menu to drop the old out dated menus and updated to our new UI layouts! 

FOOD SPOTS & GROCERY STORES
â€¢ Food locations no longer take away stress. After a long time thinking about it, we really needed to remove stress from food items as the weed shops are useless with so many destress options.
â€¢ Gas stations now offer food still, but its much better to shop at a restaurant and or food joint then shopping from AI shops.
â€¢ All restaurants now offer more food consumption for hunger and thirst, meaning most meals from restaurants will essentially fill you plenty up for hunger and thirst with some left over making shopping these locations much better then public options.
â€¢ Players can still get their own food from stores but it will never amount to the food joints. This encourages people to roleplay with these businesses instead of doing everything yourself.
â€¢ Pizza This improved progress bars by a little bit, but not much!
â€¢ Mochi was giving thirst and hunger when it was only supposed to give hunger. This was patched.

WEED SHOPS
â€¢ Weed shops consumables and smokable's now all over stress relief and a tiny bit of armor. Nothing crazy but its something!
â€¢ Weed shops now are the main source for de-stressing in the city. We want to ensure all locations offer an expertise and make all business competitive in their own fields. Food locations will now center around hunger and thirst and weed shops will offer stress relief and a tiny bit of armor
â€¢ Players can still grow their own weed but it will only ever destress them and even at that, will never amount to the dispos. This encourages people to roleplay with these businesses instead of doing everything yourself.

DISPATCH
â€¢ Updated dispatch calls and dropped un-needed information
â€¢ Dropped car jacking calls per there request.
â€¢ EMS will no longer get calls if players are downed and hit G while in paintball.
â€¢ EMS and Police can now do `/311s` or `/911s` after they have attached to a call, to send a message to the person calling in! This was highly requested!

YOGA
â€¢ We have now made Yoga mats that will allow you to destress and do an activity to destress!
â€¢ Simply buy a yoga mat and get your yoga on!
â€¢ Use the yoga may anywhere you want and start to relax!
â€¢ Skill check and immersive sounds make it super relaxing and destressing for you and your friends!
â€¢ Once done simply third eye the mat and pick it back up!
â€¢ Check #ðŸ“¸teasers for video of the Yoga Mats.

DISPENSARIES
â€¢ Dispensaries now have their own branded vehicles for deliveries and events! They will need to use these vehicles when doing those deliveries. If you do not, you will waste your time just a heads up!
â€¢ Now you will start deliveries at the computer terminal, and then pick up your tickets at your vehicle spawners by third eyeing the truck! Don't forget to grab a ticket by hitting E on the ped outside the vehicle spawner!
â€¢ Updated Puff Puff and White Widow to now feature a selection menu when ordering supplies. This allows them to evenly supply their locations with products and fill the supply and demand! Check #ðŸ“¸teasers for more information and a look at it!

HUNTING
â€¢ We have given the vehicle that is given with the job max upgrades and armor for you guys hunting.
â€¢ Remember when vehicles are given to you, you are supposed to use them! Don't waste your time!

â€¢ When EMS or Police do `/311s` the notification shows up to the caller now in the center right of your screen and displays for 30 seconds. The notification is just a basic notification, so please pay attention! We also added a little sound effect that plays when getting it as well!

OTTERS
â€¢ Attempted to remedy the situation with vehicles spawning in the lot. It should check the area and pick up the vehicle spawns making it so that the locals do not choose those spots anymore! Please let us know if this fixes the situation if you are at Otters! 
â€¢ Extended Storages for everything. Main storage, managers, safe, and lockers
